Release v0.1

Henry Wright.

First Release! The operating system is working and I have provided a few examples of different ways of manipulating data.

Functionality so far:
1.	Define variables which are saved to and recalled from the internal memory (EEPROM) of the Arduino.
2.	Send the variables in memory to TS and receive new data when variables in TS are changed.
3.	Write (Burn) these variables to the EEPROM.
4.	Send measurement variables at a defined rate to TS for display and logging.
5.	Receive commands to execute certain functions on the Arduino. i.e. switch an output on or off.
6.	Provide a task based timing system to execute tasks with feedback if those tasks have overrun.


Known Bugs:
 - Always get the warning about version number being unexpected. This is apparently normal since TS wants to only be used
   with "approved devices. So we are sort of spoofing a speeduino. 
 - TS sometimes disconnects while waiting for a burn and takes a few trys to actually burn large data.
 - EEProm Clear function does not work, TS forces a re-connect and reboot, probably same problem as above.


Development Direction:
 - Working on supporting Arduino Uno (1kb EEPROM)
 - Moving to structure based method of sending serial data. Should be much less tedious than updating FullStatus[XX]
 - CAN bus standard functions and enable conditions.
